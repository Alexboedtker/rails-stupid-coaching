First Rails Challenge during the Le Wagon bootcamp:

Objective: Implement a simple Rails application with 2 pages:

1.) A form with an input, where a user can type a question to ask the Coach
2.) After submitting the form, the user is redirected to another page where they will see their question and the coach's answer.
